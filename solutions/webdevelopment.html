            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-3">Introduction to Web Development</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Web development is the process of designing, building, and maintaining websites and web applications.
                It combines programming, design, and system architecture to create interactive, scalable, and efficient
                digital platforms.
                In the modern digital era, web development plays a crucial role in communication, business, education,
                and technology.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-3">
                Web development is not limited to creating static web pages; it also involves building complex systems
                such as
                web-based applications, cloud platforms, dashboards, APIs, and real-time services.
                It integrates multiple technologies including front-end development, back-end development, databases,
                and network communication.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Core Components of Web Development</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Web development is broadly divided into three main components: front-end, back-end, and database
                systems.
                Each component plays a specific role in delivering a complete web solution.
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mt-3 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Front-End:</strong> User interface and client-side interaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Back-End:</strong> Server-side logic and application processing.</li>
                <li><strong>Database:</strong> Storage and management of data.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Front-End Development</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Front-end development focuses on designing the visual and interactive parts of a website that users
                directly interact with.
                It involves creating responsive layouts, user interfaces, and dynamic content using web technologies.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mt-3">Key Technologies</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li>HTML for structure and content</li>
                <li>CSS for styling and layout</li>
                <li>JavaScript for interactivity and logic</li>
                <li>Frameworks and libraries such as React, Vue, and Angular</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-3">
                Modern front-end development emphasizes responsive design, accessibility, performance optimization,
                and cross-browser compatibility.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Back-End Development</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Back-end development deals with server-side programming and application logic.
                It handles user authentication, data processing, business logic, and communication with databases and
                external services.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mt-3">Common Back-End Technologies</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mt-2 space-y-1">

                <li>RESTful APIs and GraphQL</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-3">
                Back-end systems must be scalable, secure, and efficient to support large numbers of users and data
                transactions.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Database Systems</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Databases are used to store, retrieve, and manage data in web applications.
                They are classified into relational and non-relational database systems.
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mt-3 space-y-1">
