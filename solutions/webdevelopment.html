            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Web development is the process of designing, building, and maintaining websites and web applications.
                It combines programming, design, and system architecture to create interactive, scalable, and efficient
                digital platforms.
                In the modern digital era, web development plays a crucial role in communication, business, education,
                and technology.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-3">
                Web development is not limited to creating static web pages; it also involves building complex systems
                such as
                web-based applications, cloud platforms, dashboards, APIs, and real-time services.
                It integrates multiple technologies including front-end development, back-end development, databases,
                and network communication.

        <div>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Core Components of Web Development</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Web development is broadly divided into three main components: front-end, back-end, and database
                systems.
                Each component plays a specific role in delivering a complete web solution.
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mt-3 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Front-End:</strong> User interface and client-side interaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Back-End:</strong> Server-side logic and application processing.</li>
                <li><strong>Database:</strong> Storage and management of data.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Front-End Development</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Front-end development focuses on designing the visual and interactive parts of a website that users
                directly interact with.
                It involves creating responsive layouts, user interfaces, and dynamic content using web technologies.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mt-3">Key Technologies</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mt-2 space-y-1">
