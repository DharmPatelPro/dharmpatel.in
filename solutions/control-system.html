            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Control systems are a fundamental part of modern engineering and technology. They are used to regulate,
                manage, and control the behavior of machines, processes, and dynamic systems. The main objective of a
                control
                system is to ensure that the output of a system follows a desired input with high accuracy, stability,
                and efficiency.
                Control systems are widely applied in robotics, automation, electrical engineering, aerospace,
                mechanical systems,
                and industrial processes.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-3">
                With the rapid development of automation and intelligent machines, control systems have become
                increasingly
                important. From simple household devices like fans and refrigerators to complex systems such as
                autonomous robots
                and aircraft navigation systems, control theory provides the mathematical and conceptual framework to
                design
                reliable and efficient systems.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Basic Concept of Control Systems</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                A control system is a system that takes an input signal, processes it using a controller, and produces
                an output.
                In many systems, the output is measured and compared with the desired input to determine the error. The
                controller
                then adjusts the system to reduce this error. This process is known as feedback control.
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mt-3 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Reference Input:</strong> Desired value or target output.</li>
                <li><strong>Controller:</strong> Computes the control action based on error.</li>
                <li><strong>Plant/System:</strong> Physical system being controlled.</li>
                <li><strong>Output:</strong> Actual response of the system.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Measurement of output used for correction.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Classification of Control Systems</h2>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mt-2">1. Open-Loop Control Systems</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                In an open-loop control system, the control action is independent of the output. There is no feedback
                mechanism,
                which makes the system simple and easy to design. However, open-loop systems cannot compensate for
                disturbances
                or variations in system parameters, which reduces their accuracy.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">
                Examples include washing machines with fixed timers, electric heaters without temperature sensors,
                and basic motor control systems without feedback.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mt-4">2. Closed-Loop Control Systems</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                In a closed-loop control system, the output is continuously monitored and compared with the reference
                input.
                The difference between them is called the error signal. The controller uses this error to adjust the
                control input,
                making closed-loop systems more accurate, stable, and robust.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">
                Examples include temperature control systems using thermostats, speed control of motors using encoders,
                and robotic manipulators using position feedback.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Mathematical Modeling of Control Systems</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Mathematical modeling is essential for analyzing and designing control systems. It involves representing
                a physical
                system using mathematical equations. Two common approaches are transfer function modeling and
                state-space modeling.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mt-2">Transfer Function</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                The transfer function of a system is defined as the ratio of the Laplace transform of the output to the
                input,
                assuming zero initial conditions. It is expressed as:
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-800 font-mono mt-2">
                G(s) = Y(s) / U(s)
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mt-4">State-Space Representation</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                State-space modeling represents a system using a set of first-order differential equations. It is widely
                used in
                modern control systems and robotics because it can handle multi-input and multi-output systems
                effectively.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Controllers in Control Systems</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Controllers are the core of a control system. They determine how the system responds to the error
                signal.
                The most commonly used controller in engineering is the PID controller.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mt-2">PID Controller</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                A PID controller consists of three terms: Proportional (P), Integral (I), and Derivative (D).
                Each term contributes to improving system performance.
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mt-3 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Proportional (P):</strong> Responds to the current error.</li>
                <li><strong>Integral (I):</strong> Eliminates steady-state error.</li>
                <li><strong>Derivative (D):</strong> Predicts future error based on rate of change.</li>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Performance Characteristics of Control Systems</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                The performance of a control system is evaluated using several parameters such as stability, transient
                response,
                steady-state error, and robustness.

            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mt-3 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Ability of a system to return to equilibrium after disturbance.</li>
                <li><strong>Transient Response:</strong> Behavior of the system during changes in input.</li>
                <li><strong>Steady-State Error:</strong> Error after the system reaches steady state.</li>
                <li><strong>Robustness:</strong> Ability to maintain performance under uncertainties.</li>

                operation
