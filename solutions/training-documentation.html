    <section class="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-6 py-10 text-gray-800">
        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Engineering Training and Technical Documentation</h1>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Engineering training and technical documentation are essential pillars of modern engineering practice.
            While engineering training focuses on developing practical skills and real-world problem-solving
            abilities, technical documentation ensures that knowledge, designs, and processes are clearly recorded,
            shared, and maintained. Together, they improve efficiency, collaboration, and quality in engineering
            projects.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Engineering Training</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
            Engineering training is the process of gaining hands-on experience with tools, technologies, and
            methodologies used in engineering. Unlike theoretical learning, training emphasizes practical
            implementation, experimentation, and system-level understanding.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
            Training can include working with mechanical systems, electronics, embedded systems, control systems,
            software development, robotics, manufacturing processes, and simulation tools. Through training,
            engineers learn how to design, build, test, debug, and optimize real systems.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">a) Types of Engineering Training</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-3">
            <li>Industrial training in manufacturing plants and engineering companies.</li>
            <li>Laboratory training in universities and research institutions.</li>
            <li>Project-based training through robotics, IoT, and automation projects.</li>
            <li>Software and simulation training using CAD, MATLAB, ROS, and programming languages.</li>
            <li>Internships and collaborative industry-academia programs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">b) Importance of Engineering Training</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">
            Engineering training bridges the gap between theory and practice. It helps engineers understand how
            theoretical concepts behave in real-world conditions. Training also improves problem-solving skills,
            teamwork, communication, and professional confidence.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
            In fields like robotics, embedded systems, and manufacturing, training is critical because systems are
            complex and multidisciplinary. Engineers must understand interactions between mechanical, electrical,
            and software components to design reliable solutions.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Technical Documentation</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
            Technical documentation is the structured recording of engineering knowledge, designs, processes, and
            results. It includes documents that describe how systems are designed, built, tested, and maintained.
            Good documentation ensures that engineering work is understandable, reproducible, and scalable.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
            Documentation is not just a formality; it is a technical asset. Without proper documentation, knowledge
            is lost when team members leave, systems become difficult to maintain, and projects become hard to
            scale or improve.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">a) Types of Technical Documentation</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-3">
            <li>System architecture documents and block diagrams.</li>
            <li>Mechanical drawings and CAD files.</li>
            <li>Electronic schematics and PCB design files.</li>
            <li>Software documentation, APIs, and code comments.</li>
            <li>Test reports, validation results, and performance analysis.</li>
            <li>User manuals, maintenance guides, and safety instructions.</li>
            <li>Project reports and version-controlled repositories.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">b) Characteristics of Good Documentation</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">
            Effective technical documentation is clear, structured, accurate, and updated. It uses diagrams,
            tables, flowcharts, and standardized terminology to communicate complex ideas in a simple way.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
            Good documentation also follows logical organization, such as system overview, design details,
            implementation steps, testing procedures, and future improvements.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Relationship Between Training and Documentation</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
            Engineering training and technical documentation are closely connected. During training, engineers
            learn how systems work and how to solve problems. Documentation captures this knowledge so that it can
            be reused and shared with others.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
            In project-based environments, engineers often document their training outcomes in the form of design
            notes, experiment logs, and technical reports. This practice improves learning quality and project
            continuity.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Role in Modern Engineering Projects</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
            In modern engineering projects, especially in robotics, embedded systems, and industrial automation,
            training and documentation determine project success. Teams with strong technical skills and clear
            documentation can develop complex systems faster and with fewer errors.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
            Documentation also supports collaboration between mechanical, electrical, and software teams. It acts
            as a common technical language that aligns understanding across disciplines.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
            Engineering training builds practical competence, while technical documentation preserves and
            communicates engineering knowledge. Together, they form the backbone of professional engineering
            practice. Engineers who invest in both hands-on training and high-quality documentation are better
            prepared to design, innovate, and maintain complex systems in the modern technological world.
