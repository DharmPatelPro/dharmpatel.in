        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">3D Design and Digital Manufacturing</h1>
        <p class="mb-4">
            3D design is the foundation of modern engineering and manufacturing. It involves creating digital
            models of physical objects using computer-aided design (CAD) tools and converting these models into
            real-world products using technologies like 3D printing, CNC machining, laser cutting, and advanced
            material processing. Today, 3D design plays a crucial role in mechanical engineering, robotics,
            electronics, architecture, automotive industries, and product development.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Computer-Aided Design (CAD)</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
            CAD is the process of designing objects using specialized software such as SolidWorks, Fusion 360,
            Onshape, CATIA, or AutoCAD. Engineers use CAD to create precise 2D drawings and 3D models that define
            the geometry, dimensions, tolerances, and assembly relationships of components.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
            CAD models are not just visual representations; they contain critical engineering information.
            Features like parametric design, constraints, assemblies, and simulations allow designers to test
            ideas virtually before manufacturing. This reduces errors, saves cost, and speeds up the development
            process.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. 3D Printing (Additive Manufacturing)</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
            3D printing is an additive manufacturing process where objects are built layer by layer from digital
            models. Common technologies include FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling), SLA (Stereolithography), and SLS
            (Selective Laser Sintering).
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
            3D printing is widely used for rapid prototyping, custom parts, robotics components, and lightweight
            structures. It allows engineers to quickly test designs, iterate faster, and produce complex geometries
            that are difficult or impossible to manufacture using traditional methods.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. CNC Machining</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
            CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machining is a subtractive manufacturing process where material is
            removed from a solid block using cutting tools controlled by computer programs. CNC machines include
            mills, lathes, routers, and multi-axis machining centers.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
            Compared to 3D printing, CNC machining offers higher precision, better surface finish, and stronger
            parts. It is commonly used for metal components, mechanical parts, molds, and high-performance
            engineering applications.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Laser Cutting and Engraving</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
            Laser cutting uses a focused laser beam to cut or engrave materials such as acrylic, wood, plastics,
            and metals. It is widely used in fabrication labs, electronics enclosures, signage, and precision
            parts manufacturing.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
            Laser technology provides high accuracy, clean edges, and fast production speed. Designers often use
            CAD files (DXF, SVG, or DWG) to directly control laser machines, making it an important tool in the
            digital manufacturing workflow.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. Composite Materials</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
            Composite materials are made by combining two or more different materials to achieve superior
            properties such as high strength, low weight, and durability. Examples include carbon fiber, glass
            fiber, and reinforced polymers.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
            In 3D design, composites are used in aerospace, robotics, automotive parts, and sports equipment.
            Designing with composites requires understanding material behavior, layering techniques, and stress
            distribution, which are often analyzed using simulation tools in CAD software.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">6. Metals in 3D Design and Manufacturing</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
            Metals such as aluminum, steel, brass, and titanium are essential in engineering design. Metal parts
            are typically manufactured using CNC machining, casting, sheet metal fabrication, or metal 3D printing.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
            Designing metal components requires knowledge of mechanical properties, tolerances, thermal behavior,
            and manufacturing constraints. Engineers must optimize designs to balance strength, weight, cost, and
            manufacturability.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">7. Importance of 3D Design in Engineering</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
            3D design connects creativity with engineering reality. It allows engineers to visualize ideas,
            analyze performance, and manufacture products efficiently. In robotics and embedded systems, 3D design
            is essential for creating custom mechanical structures, housings, and mechanisms.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
            With the integration of CAD, simulation, and digital manufacturing, engineers can build complex systems
            faster and with higher accuracy. As industries move toward automation and smart manufacturing, 3D
            design becomes a core skill for modern engineers.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
            3D design is more than just modeling shapes; it is a complete engineering workflow that includes
            design, analysis, material selection, and manufacturing. From CAD modeling to CNC machining, laser
            cutting, 3D printing, and advanced materials, 3D design forms the backbone of modern product
            development and innovation.
