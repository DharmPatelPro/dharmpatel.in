                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">Namaste, I am Dharm Patel. I am a Robotics & Automation Engineer
                        passionate about building intelligent systems. My expertise lies in designing precise control
                        systems, programming embedded hardware (STM32, IoT), and creating robust mechanical designs
                        using Onshape.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6"> I bring a proven track record of high-performance engineering,
                        demonstrated by representing
                        India on the international stage at ABU Robocon 2025. Beyond technical development, I possess
                        strong leadership capabilities, having successfully trained and directed hundreds of students in
                        robotics workshops. I am eager to apply these skills to contribute to your organization's
                        vision.</p>
